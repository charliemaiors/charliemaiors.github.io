Welcome to my first blog post. Let me introduce myself, I'm a Computer Engineer and research grants for University of Bologna. My research fields are Cloud Computing for a system perspective, Blockchain (from a model and implementation point of view, no cryptocurrencies). I'm also interested in DevOps and CI/CD tools.
Beyond nerd stuff I love travel, pratice sports and cook/eat.

I will write about my projects (with some wiki), travels and food.

Thanks for your time.
