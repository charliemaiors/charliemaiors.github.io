# Why test Nginx Plus?

Nowadays Nginx is one of the most popular web server/reverse proxy and  loadbalancer, let alone as Ingress/IngressController on Kubernetes which was one of the first implementations and the most used.  
Nginx offers (among the other products) is tiered in 2 levels: the open source, and the plus implementation.  
The Plus implementation offers, beyond the functionalities offered by the open source version, many other interesting features (for a more detailed comparison look at [this comparison](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/compare-models)):

* Active/Passive application health checking
* Activity monitoring
* Advanced Loadbalancing
* Reconfiguration on-the-fly
* Extended logging capabilities
* Adaptive media streaming
* High availability setup  

I've tried the healthcheck feature on the minio cluster (check the [article](https://www.carlomaiorano.me/freebsd/2021/02/21/minio-ha.html)), and also the dashboard to check the current state of the web server. I'm also planning to test the extended logging and the high availability setup.  

## Ask for a license

The license is available **ONLY** for side **NON**-commercial projects.
