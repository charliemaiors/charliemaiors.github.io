# My journey with Gitlab

When I was a research grant at the university we had a problem with SCM, we rely on an old SVN server with all the projects on it and we want to migrate to git. Among the differents on-premise offers (like [Gogs](https://gogs.io/), [Bitbucket server](https://it.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download)) we choose [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) because was (and is) the best on premise SCM solution (and IMHO is growing up quickly also on cloud).
I had a spare bare metal machine, see [figure](optiplex)

where I can make all the experiments that I want.
