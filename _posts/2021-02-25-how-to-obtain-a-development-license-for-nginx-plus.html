<p>Nowadays, Nginx is one of the most popular web servers/reverse proxy and load balancer, let alone Ingress/IngressController on Kubernetes which was one of the first and most used implementations.<br>Nginx offers (among the other products) is tiered in 2 levels: the open source, and the plus implementation.<br>The Plus implementation offers, beyond the functionalities offered by the open-source version, many other interesting features (for a more detailed comparison look at <a href="https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/compare-models">this comparison</a>):</p><ul><li>Active/Passive application health checking</li><li>Activity monitoring</li><li>Advanced Loadbalancing</li><li>Reconfiguration on-the-fly</li><li>Extended logging capabilities</li><li>Adaptive media streaming</li><li>High availability setup</li></ul><p>I’ve tried the health check feature on the Minio cluster (check the <a href="https://www.carlomaiorano.me/freebsd/2021/02/21/minio-ha.html">article</a>) and the dashboard to check the current state of the web server. I also plan to test the extended logging and the high availability setup.</p><h3>Ask for a license</h3><p>The license is available <strong>ONLY</strong> for side <strong>NON</strong>-commercial projects. In order to request the license you have to send an email to the <a href="mailto:devsupport@nginx.com?subject=Nginx%20Plus%20dev%20license">devsupport</a> explaining why you need a dev license; I wrote a few lines about what I’m doing and one sentence on what I want to do with the Plus version of Nginx.<br> After a while (some days) you will receive a code that must be filled in the <a href="https://www.nginx.com/developer-license/">developer license portal</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2yJVpRo7JFjtBC9P.png" /></figure><p>After that, you will receive an mail with an activation URL to download the key for the license. To install Nginx Plus on your distribution (Nginx Plus is a different package from Nginx open source), check the <a href="https://cs.nginx.com/repo_setup">repo_setup</a> site.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Nginx Plus has many interesting features and Nginx’s dev support is very kind to provide a free license for home/side projects.</p><p><em>Originally published at </em><a href="https://www.carlomaiorano.me/nginx/2021/02/25/nginx-plus.html"><em>https://www.carlomaiorano.me</em></a><em> on February 25, 2021.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=25f821e10e80" width="1" height="1" alt="">
