# Quick and dirty Google Drive client for linux with Rclone and Systemd

Google Drive IMHO is one of the best consumer-oriented cloud storage services, is very efficient and versatile with also the gdocs suite (not the G-Suite which is for business). BTW it lacks of (or even better is still under development) the linux client. There are many solutions which overcome this absence:

* Insync
* overGrive
* Rclone + hacks

The frst two are  pure desktop clients, useful on a development box.
